Arrays - 
    Pros
    Improves readability, multiple values in single variable
    Cons


   1) Fixed in size -> Can't increase or decrease size based on requirement, we must know 
    size in advance, which may not be possible.
   2) 
   
      Homogeneous -> 
      Student[] s = new Student[10000];
      s[0] = new Student();
      s[1] = new Customer(); // error Incompatible type found Customer required Student
      
      Solution -
      Object[] a = new Object[10000];
      a[0] = new Student();
      a[1] = new Customer();
      
  3) Arrays concept is not implemented based on standard data structure -> Programmer has to write 
  all logic, sorting, searching
      
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Collections - Ready made method support, methods like contains
  Implemented as standard data structure
  
  1) Growable -> Collections are growable in nature, i.e we can increase or decrease the 
  size.
  
  2) Homogeneous or Heterogeneous -> Collections can hold both homogeneous or heterogeneous elements.
  
  3) Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure, hence for every
  requirement readymade standard support is available. Being a programmer we are responsible to use 
  those methods and we are not responsible to implement those methods.

Memory wise - collections is good

Performance wise - Arrays is good

if you want to add new element in ArrayList
  -> Make new ArrayList with new size
  -> Copy old elements
  -> Add new element
  -> Reassign reference variable
  -> old ArrayList GC
  
  Collections can hold only objects. -> Integer only
  Arrays can hold both primitives and objects. -> Integer[], int[]
  
  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Collection -> Used to represent group of individual objects as a single entity.
 Collection Framework -> It contains several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
 
 Java and C++
 Collection <-> Container
 Collection Framework <-> STL
